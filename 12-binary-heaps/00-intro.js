// Binary Heaps

// MaxBinaryHeap:
// - Parent nodes are always larger > child nodes
// - But no implied ordering between sibling nodes
// - Each parent has at most TWO child nodes
// - Binary heaps are as compact as possible, all the children of each node are as full as they can be and left children are filled out first

// ie:
//        100
//     19      36
//   17  3   25   1
// 2   7

// MinBinaryHeap, parend nodes are always smaller < child nodes
// ie:
//            1
//       2          3
//   17    19     36   7
// 25 100
