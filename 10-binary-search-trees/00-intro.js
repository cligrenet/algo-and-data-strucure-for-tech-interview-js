//// -------------- Trees
// Types:
// 1-trees
// 2-binary trees
// 3-binary search trees

// A data structure that consists of nodes in a parent/child relationship
// list - linear
// tree - nonlinear (many different paths)

// Terminology:
// root (only ONE, top node of the tree), children, parent, siblings, leaf (a node with no children), edge (the connection between one node and another)

// Use cases:
// - HTML DOM
// - Network routing
// - Abstract syntax trees
// - Artificial Intelligence
// - Decision tree
// - Folders in an operating system
// - JSON parse into an object

////  -------------- Binary Tree
// Every parent node has at most two children

////  -------------- Binary Search Tree
// Every parent node has at most two children
// Every node to the left of a parent node is always less than the parent
// Every node to the right of a parent node is always greater than the parent

// Compare -> cut in half -> decide go left or go right

// Complexity:
// Space - avg: O(N), worst: O(n)
// Search - avg: O(log n), worst: O(n)
// Insert - avg: O(log n), worst: O(n)
// Delete - avg: O(log n), worst: O(n)
